MS539 Final Project <<incremental>>

Health Information Tracker

Health Information Tracker will provide a GUI interface to allow a user to save
various health information data points.  These data points will drive the charts
you see on some of the screens.

The health information this program will collect and display are:

1.	Personally Identifiable Information
2.	Blood Glucose readings
3.	Pulse and Oxygen % readings

	Overview:
	The user interface is critical to the success of any software project.    
	The goal this week is to improve your application to improve the UI.

	Guidelines:
	Before starting any coding, write down your estimate of how long you 
	anticipate the development of the project to take. Put this in a comment 
	at the top of your code below the header comment (name, date, program description).  
	Each time you work on the code, log the amount of time spent and date below the 
	estimate.  When you have completed the project, compute the number of hours it took to 
	complete it and note this then write a paragraph analysis on why it took longer/shorter 
	and how you can improve for the next project.  This can be done in a Word document 
	or as comments in your code.

	Expectations:
	Update your previous version of your final project.  Improve your UI based on your 
	reading, research, and learning.

	Deliverables:
	You must include an executable along with all your files with the improvements listed 
	above. Zip your project directory.

	Include a word document that explains the changes made to UI and why they were made.

	Please review the rubrics – this is how the assignment will be graded.
